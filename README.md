## About project
This project aims to propose guidelines for preventing personal data breaches and complying with personal data laws in the field of images or video especially and also intends to study machine learning and image processing.</br>
(-) Collect data from Youtube videos and collect data manually.</br>
(-) Using Roboflow for label, preprocessing and Augmentations.</br>
(-) Using yolov8m and faster-RCNN to train model.</br>
(-) Using openCV to read data from image or video for bluring face and vehicle license plate.</br>
